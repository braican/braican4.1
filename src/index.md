lede: Let's build something useful.

main: |
  Hey, I'm Nick; a design-focused developer who has over nine years of experience working directly with people to build strategies and impactful online experiences for their brands.

  Full time, I spend my days leading technology at <a href="https://upstatement.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upstatement</a>, a digital studio based in Boston. I live in Portland, Oregon because the skiing is better out here.

  Sometimes I make my own beer and it usually comes out alright. I also have a tendency to yell at Boston sports teams.

promo: I'm available to work with you on whatever you've got going next. Just give me a shout and let's build something sweet.
