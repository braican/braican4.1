lede: Let's build something.

main: |
  I'm a design-focused developer who has over nine years of experience working directly with people to build strategies and impactful online experiences for their brands.

  Full time, I spend my days leading technology at [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com), a digital studio based in Boston. I live in Portland, Oregon because the skiing is better out here.

  Sometimes I make my own beer and it usually comes out alright. I also have a tendency to yell at Boston sports teams.

promo: I'm available to work with you on your next thing. Give me a shout.
