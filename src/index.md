Hey, I'm Nick; a design-focused developer who has over nine years of experience working directly with people to build strategies and impactful online experiences for their&nbsp;brands.

Full time, I spend my days leading technology at <a href="https://upstatement.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upstatement</a>, a digital studio based in Boston. I live in Portland, Oregon because the skiing is better out&nbsp;here.

Sometimes I make my own beer and it usually comes out alright. I also have a tendency to yell at Boston sports&nbsp;teams.
